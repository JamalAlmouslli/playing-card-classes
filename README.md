# playing-card-classes

This includes deck and card classes that can be added to an existing project to utilize a customizable deck of standard playing cards. It is written in C++11 and utilizes [Boost][1] (`boost:unordered_map`) for mapping the card values in a nice syntax.

`main()` provides an idea of its basic usage by displaying the standard 52-card deck, but it can be used for other purposes, such as games that don't a 52-card deck setup.

In the future, I'd like to make it into something like a library, but this could work for now.
